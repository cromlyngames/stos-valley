From my quick look over:
This is not pep8 compliant. Please run it through a pep8 cleaner.
Block comments should be in triple quotes, not large blocks of #.
Adding a 2 to a variable name is confusing: https://github.com/cromlyngames/stos-valley/blob/master/fantasy-foodweb#L1514
You mix up your naming style. Try to stick to first_last when naming variables and functions.
It's a python file but doesn't have a .py extension or a #!/usr/bin/env python at the start
comments with a # need to have a space after the #
forenamelist and surnamelist take up too many lines. Put them in a separate file and read them in. If you don't do that, try putting multiple names on a line
https://github.com/cromlyngames/stos-valley/blob/master/fantasy-foodweb#L945 dictofdicts is the not a very informative variable name. Please make it more descriptive
if(Temp_value < incoming_light): if statements do not need parenthesis around them
Why are you mixing indentation styles with your if..else? https://github.com/cromlyngames/stos-valley/blob/master/fantasy-foodweb#L1109 Do it like this:
if condition:
    a = 1
else:
    a = 2
This function does way too much. Try splitting it up: https://github.com/cromlyngames/stos-valley/blob/master/fantasy-foodweb#L1140
This code uses too many global variables, try making a class so that you only expose the necessary methods of your creation logic.

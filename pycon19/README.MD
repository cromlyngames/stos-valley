What this workshop is about:

1) playing with some working code, breaking it, fixing it and playing some more
2) it is not about teaching you all of python in 60-90min.
3) playing around with 

# Principals: 
Like baking, or painting, coding is a craft. Anyone can do it, and practice makes you better
Documentation is like lunch. Even a small bit in a rush is much much better then skipping it
Everyone around is interested and a beginner who is learning quickly. This means if you are stuck, they might know that bit! ask!
In fact, pairing up is a standard professional programming technique!
Unlike engineering, there are huge and fantastic help guides online. Try and visit stackexchange at least once this session.



First Program: 

Open Ananconda, Open spyder.
Type the below into the main window (on the left). Then click the Green play button on the top ribbon. something should appear on the bottom right.

  # my first program comment
  print("Hello world!")


Five Minutes Later. try this:

  import turtle
  
  turtle.forward(50)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(100)
  turtle.left(90)
  turtle.forwards(50)


Five Minutes later:
got to here https://github.com/cromlyngames/stos-valley/new/master/pycon19
and download and open or copy and past the Turtle_mon.py program into spyder and play it. What does it do?
